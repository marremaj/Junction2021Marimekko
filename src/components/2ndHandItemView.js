The celebration was going to take place in the summery archipelago so right when I saw the dress in the store I was certain this was the right dress for the occasion. The dress came with me on the boat over the sea to the island.
We had a barbeque, played some games and enjoyed each other's company. I was happy to see everyone again. I even got some compliments on the dress. I will cherish this memory for a long time to come.""
